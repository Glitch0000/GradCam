# GradCam
This reopsitory we will walk through generating gradient-weighted class activation maps (GradCAMs) for model predictions.  This is similar to the CAMs we generated in the previous repsitories except: GradCAMs uses gradients instead of the global average pooling weights to weight the activations.
